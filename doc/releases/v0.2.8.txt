v0.2.8 (........)
------------------------

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``Study.tidy_splicing_with_expression`` now deals with when splicing events
  map to multiple gene names. Fixes #304 with #309.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rasterize lavalamp plot for visualizing many splicing events at once,
  otherwise the image is too big. PR #308
- Change modality estimation to a two-step process: Estimate :math:`$\Psi~0` and :math:`$\Psi~1`
  first, which change 1 parameter of the Beta distribution at a time,
  then bimodal and middle, which change both parameters of the Beta
  distribution at once.
- Add more tutorials and separate out getting started and analyses
  - Added advanced tutorial which uses COMBAT to correct for batch effects in
    Allen Brain Institute's Developing Brain Transcriptome (Brainspan)
  - Added initial investigation of Brainspan data involving using a classifier
    on hippocampus tissues.
  - Separated Shalek et al 2013 "getting started" and recreating figures

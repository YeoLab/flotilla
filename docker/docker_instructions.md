Docker is an application that runs a virtual machine that runs software on your computer in an isolated environment.

Here are instructions to get an active docker image. These instructions have not been tested on Windows or Linux.

Note: On Mac OS X and Windows you will need to start docker through the “boot2docker” application before you can use docker.

  1. Install docker ( ≥ version 1.3) according to the [instructions appropriate for your system](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation).<br>
  2. Then start flotilla on the command line (OS X `Terminal` application):
  

    <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YeoLab/flotilla/master/docker/start_docker.py | python</code>


After the ipython notebook interface opens, test the installation with our test dataset by running the following commands in a new notebook:

    import flotilla
    study = flotilla.embark("http://sauron.ucsd.edu/flotilla_projects/neural_diff_chr22/datapackage.json")
    study.interactive_pca()
    
Thanks for using flotilla!

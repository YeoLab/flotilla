v0.2.8 (........)
-----------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``Study.modality_log2bf()`` which will get the log2 bayes factor
  for each splicing event's fit to each modality in each phenotype

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- ``Study.tidy_splicing_with_expression`` now deals with when splicing events
  map to multiple gene names. Fixes #304 with #309.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rasterize lavalamp plot for visualizing many splicing events at once,
  otherwise the image is too big. PR #308
- Change modality estimation to a two-step process: Estimate :math:`$\Psi~0` and :math:`$\Psi~1`
  first, which change 1 parameter of the Beta distribution at a time,
  then bimodal and middle, which change both parameters of the Beta
  distribution at once.
- Make sure both modality estimation and NMF space calculation use at least
  20 samples per event
- Get rid of ``big_nmf_space_transitions`` for now
